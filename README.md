# GoogleColab_GitHub
Use GitHub's private repositories in Google Colaboratory.

Colaboratory is a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud
https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb.

The only things you need are:
- Google account
- If repository is private -> invitation as collaborator needed
- Github token:
